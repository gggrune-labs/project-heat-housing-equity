# Results

## Overview
This project analyzes large-scale civic service request data to identify structural patterns of housing-related distress and evaluate whether statistical and analytical techniques can be used to **predict risk before harm escalates**. Using exploratory analysis, regression, and analysis of variance (ANOVA), the results demonstrate that housing distress is **measurable, non-random, and systematically concentrated** across time and geography.

## Dataset Summary
- **Observations:** 100,000+ service records  
- **Attributes:** 10+ variables including complaint type, location, time, and response characteristics  
- **Time Range:** Multi-year historical data  
- **Domain:** Housing conditions and public service complaints  

The dataset met the project’s requirements for scale, dimensionality, and real-world applicability.

## Key Analytical Findings

### 1. Descriptive & Exploratory Analysis
- Housing-related complaints exhibit **clear temporal patterns**, with recurring seasonal spikes.
- Certain complaint categories (e.g., heat, water, and maintenance-related issues) appear **disproportionately often**, indicating systemic infrastructure stress rather than isolated incidents.
- Geographic clustering revealed **persistent hotspots**, suggesting long-term inequities in housing conditions and service resolution.

---

### 2. Regression Analysis
- Regression models showed that **time, complaint category, and location** are statistically significant predictors of complaint frequency.
- The models explained a meaningful portion of variance, supporting the conclusion that housing distress is **predictable rather than random**.
- Results validate regression as a viable tool for **early warning and prioritization systems**.

---

### 3. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- ANOVA tests confirmed **statistically significant differences** in complaint volumes across categories and regions.
- These differences reinforce that certain communities experience **structurally higher levels of housing distress**, even when controlling for other factors.
- The findings justify moving away from first-come, first-served service models toward **needs-based allocation**.

---

## Visual Findings
Visualizations generated in the notebook supported the statistical results by:
- Highlighting temporal trends in complaint growth
- Illustrating geographic concentration of distress
- Making disparities intuitive and accessible for non-technical stakeholders  

Together, these visuals strengthen the interpretability and usability of the analysis.

---

## Implications
The results demonstrate that:
- Housing distress can be **quantified, modeled, and forecasted**
- Statistical tools can be used not only for description, but for **preventative decision-making**
- Data-driven prioritization has the potential to reduce harm, improve equity, and optimize public resource deployment  

These findings form the analytical foundation for **Project H.E.A.T.**, a predictive framework aimed at transforming how public services respond to housing inequity.

---

## Limitations
- The analysis is based on historical complaint data and does not include post-intervention outcomes.
- Complaint data reflects reported issues and may underrepresent unreported conditions.
- Results should be interpreted as **directional and predictive**, not causal.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates that applying statistical analysis to large-scale civic data can surface actionable insights with real humanitarian value. The results support the feasibility of using analytics to shift from reactive service delivery toward **anticipatory, equity-driven systems**.
