Project H.E.A.T. analyzes NYC 311 housing complaints (2021–2023) to identify patterns of housing distress and test whether complaint volumes differ across time, location, and type. Using regression, ANOVA/ANCOVA, and baseline prediction, it demonstrates how analytics can support proactive, equity-focused service allocation.
